# SVGs and IMGs Downloader

A high-performance Chrome extension (Manifest V3) designed to streamline asset collection for designers and developers. "SVGs and IMGs" automatically scans active browser tabs to identify embedded visual elements, including inline SVGs and standard image files.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Comprehensive Detection**: Scans for all `<img>` tags and inline `<svg>` elements on the current page.
- **Visual Gallery**: Preview all discovered assets in a clean grid within the extension popup before downloading.
- **One-Click Export**: Quickly save individual icons or high-resolution images to your local machine.
- **Privacy Focused**: Uses the `activeTab` permission model, meaning it only runs when you explicitly click the extension icon.
- **Built for Modern Browsers**: Fully compliant with Chrome's Manifest V3 standards for improved security and performance.
